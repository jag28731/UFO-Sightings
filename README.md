# UFO Sightings Analysis

## Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date filter, Dana wants to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
  
### Purpose
The purpose of my project was to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape to the established date filter to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. 

## UFO Sightings Results
Below is a description of my new webpage with city, state, country, and shape filters.

### Results: How to Use Webpage
The webpage is very easy to use to get the results you are looking for. The webpage lets you filter your results using 5 categories. The categories are date, city, state, country, and shape. All you have to do to get your results is enter the information you are looking for in any of the filters to filter the results to your specific query. You can enter 1 filter or you can enter all 5. The choice is yours.

## UFO Sightings Summary

- One drawback of the webpage:
  
  The filters don't have information on which cities, state, and countries are available to search.
  
- Two recommendations for further development of the webpage:
  
  For cosmetics purposes, I would update all the information to use capital letters for the city, state, shape, and country. Another recommendation would be to add more information on what the UFO did during the sighting. Did it move, did it stand still, did it spin ect...
